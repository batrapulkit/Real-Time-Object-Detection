# Real-Time Object Detection

This project implements real-time object detection using a deep learning model YOLO. It detects various objects in live video streams, providing an efficient solution for real-time applications.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with high accuracy.
- Ability to detect multiple objects simultaneously.
- Easy-to-use interface for live video stream detection.
- Supports pre-trained models like YOLOv4, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.
- Supports webcam and video file input for detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
